                <h2><em>How to Write Your Mission Statement</em></h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                A mission statement is a key tool that can be as important as your business
                plan. It captures, in a few succinct sentences, the essence of your business's
                goals and the philosophies underlying them. Equally important, the mission
                statement signals what your business is all about to your customers,
                employees, suppliers and the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mission statement reflects every facet of your business: the range and
                nature of the products you offer, pricing, quality, service, marketplace
                position, growth potential, use of technology, and your relationships with
                your customers, employees, suppliers, competitors and the community.

                <h2><em>How to Create a Vision for Your Life</em></h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to think it was a silly waste of time to think about a vision for my
                life. Who does that? It seems to touchy-feely, too Tony Robbins-ish.

                But then, as I started learning how to change my life and my habits,
                I realized something: people avoid creating a vision for their lives
                because they believe the exercise is futile. Why make a vision when it’s
                impossible to accomplish those things anyway?

                I’ve also noticed something over the past several years: the most interesting, accomplished people I know all have a vision for their lives. They seem to know what comes next, like they’ve seen the future.
            </p>
            <h1 align="center">My Dream</h1>
            <p>
            <h2><em>What Is Your Dream?</em></h2>
                What is your dream? Will you achieve your dream in your lifetime?
                I'm certain that you desire to.
                I'm sure you hope you will. But will you actually do it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people I know have a dream. In fact, I’ve asked hundreds, if not thousands,
                of people about their dream. Some willingly describe it with great detail and enthusiasm.
                Others are reluctant to talk about it. They seem embarrassed to say it out loud.
                These people have never tested their dream. They don’t know if others will laugh at them.
                They’re not sure if they’re aiming too high or too low. They don’t
                know if their dream is something they can really achieve or if they’re destined to fail.
